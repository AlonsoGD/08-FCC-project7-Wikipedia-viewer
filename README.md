I wanted to do this without libraries, frameworks or helpers so it is just vanilla JS, CSS and HTML.
I also took the opportunity to learn CSS animations, CSS grid (very convenient and easy) vanilla JS ajax requests. I spent more time making the project visually good this time.

Not using any library or framework: Vanilla JS and CSS (only FontAwesome).

Responsive: good layout in mobile.
